# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

Customer reviews are the currency of the day for online retailers. Its been proven that greater positive reviews yield to greater sales for products. It is not only the quality of the review but the amount of reviews counts too. Amazon offeres their sellers a program called Amazon Vine which helps to provide their sellers with reviews. This program requires a small fee from the sellers and the sellers provide the products to the customers/members who will provide a review. 

For this project, we have been tasked with determining if there is any favorable bias by the Amazon Vine members when they provide the reviews. We'll determine if bias is present by looking for a difference in the percentage of 5-start reviews created by Amazon Vine members vs non-Amazon Vine members.
