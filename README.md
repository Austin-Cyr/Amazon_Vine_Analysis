# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

Customer reviews are the currency of the day for online retailers. Its been proven that greater positive reviews yield to greater sales for products. It is not only the quality of the review but the amount of reviews counts too. Amazon offeres their sellers a program called Amazon Vine which helps to provide their sellers with reviews. This program requires a small fee from the sellers and the sellers provide the products to the customers/members who will provide a review. 

For this project, we have been tasked with determining if there is any favorable bias by the Amazon Vine members when they provide the reviews. We'll determine if bias is present by looking for a difference in the percentage of 5-start reviews created by Amazon Vine members vs non-Amazon Vine members. 

## Results

### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  - #### Total Products with Paid Vine Reviews         = 248
  - #### Total Products without Paid Vine Reviews = 17,514

### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  - #### Total Vine Reviews with 5 Stars      = 102
  - #### Total Non-Vine Reviews with 5 Stars  = 5,154

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  - #### Percentage of Products with Paid Vine Reviews with 5 Stars     = 41%
  - #### Percentage of Products without Paid Vine Reviews with 5 Stars  = 29%

## Summary
  - Based on the review of this data set, it appears that there is some bias in in the Vine Member review results when they receive a product as compensation versus the number of products' reviews when persons did not receive the product as compensation. The results show that of the products that received a Paid Vine Review, 41% of them had a 5 star review. Whereas only 29% products that did not have Paid Vine Review received a 5 star review. I think that this information is interesting, but I would curious to see what is the percentage of reviews that received 5 stars were paid? And also, I'd be curious to see the buckets or distributions of the reviews by this Vine reviewers and non-Vine reviewers? This woudl help to see how skewed the overall impression of the products are.
